# Licence

# API

**lfs** is built on top of [lfs-core](https://docs.rs/lfs-core/).

If you want to display the same data in your Rust application, consider using this crate directly.

For example **[broot](https://dystroy.org/broot)** uses lfs-core to display the available size in each folder's device:
